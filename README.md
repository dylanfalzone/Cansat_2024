# Cansat_2024
Design team project including design reviews and C code for a miniature satellite that will be competing at the 2024 Cansat Competition. For a full description of my work on this project, check my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-falzone-98a7b81b6/

* NOTE: The files in this repo were a collaborative effort from an incredible team. All members have given permission for the files to be viewed here.
* Another NOTE: I personally am not credited in the design reviews, since I elected not to be in the group of 10 members who presented the slides. However, I did work on the slides and had a large hand in the satellite's development overall.
