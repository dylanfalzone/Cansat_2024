# Cansat_2024
Design team project including design reviews and C code for a miniature satellite that will be competing at the 2024 Cansat Competition.
* NOTE: The files in this repo were a collaborative effort from an incredible team. All members have given permission for the files to be viewed here.
* Another NOTE: I personally am not credited in the design reviews, since I elected not to be in the group of 10 members who presented the slides. However, I did work on the slides and oversaw much of the satellite's development overall.
